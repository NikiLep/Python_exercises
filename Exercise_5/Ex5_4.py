# Description:  Create multiple dices (at least three) and put them in a list.
# See that your dice can be rolled and the side can be shown.
# Create a small game where the best sum of three rolls wins.
# If the sum is a tie, tied dices are rolled as long as a winner is found (best side wins).
# Use functions and pass objects (or list of objects) as arguments. Use informative and clear output prints.
