# Description:  Implement the following UML diagram. Try to figure out the best way to have animals in appropriate data
#               structure in the Student class (see the link in Task 4 above, there is an example of Deck class creating
#               a deck of cards, pay attention to the relationship between the Deck class and Card class and think how
#               that information can be applied in the relationship between the Student class and Animal class).
#               Pet Class can also be called Animal (you most likely have implemented that in previous exercises).Think
#               (carefully), do you need to have the owner of the pet information in the Pet/Animal class
#               (in order to make the relationship between Student and Pet)If yes, add that.
